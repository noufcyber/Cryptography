HELLO!

the first file it's a simple package based on the RSA algorithm to provide encrypting/decrypting and digital signature signing and verifying,
supported with GUI. To run the code you need to install the following packages: tkinter,  customtkinter.

the second file it's a program that proves the weakness of the SHA1 algorithm, by finding two strings that have the same first n bits in their hash values.
you have the ability to change the hash bits to compare with, and the generated charactersâ€™ length.
